\definesubsubsection{Embed Types}
An \g{implementation} must at least support the types specified in this section if permitted by the output \g{document}, but may add additional options the implications of which are completely \g{implementation dependant}. If the output \g{document} does not support a particular type, a \comp{paragraph} containing a single \comp{url} \g{textual component} is outputted with its target and content set to the \inline$target$ \g{binding}'s value and a \g{warning} is \glink{signalling}{signalled}. If the \g{implementation} does not support the requested type at all, an \g{error} is \glink{signalling}{signalled}. \\
