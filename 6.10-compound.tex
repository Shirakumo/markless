The compound \g{directive} is a \g{compound inline directive}. It determines its \g{style} dynamically by the additive combination of present \ident{compound-options}. In the case where the style combination of two options conflicts, the style of the last option has priority. \\

Only the \g{text} held by the \g{content binding} is outputted to the \g{resulting textual component}. The \ident{compound-options} \g{identifier} cannot contain any other \gpl{directive}.\\

An \g{implementation} must at least support the options specified in this section, but may add additional options the syntax and implications of which are completely \g{implementation dependant}. If an option is found that the \g{implementation} does not support, it is ignored. \\

When a compound \g{directive} is \glink{processing}{processed}, processing begins anew over the \g{content binding}. Once the \ident{compound-options} have been \glink{full match}{fully matched}, the \g{resulting textual component} is ended and control is handed back to the \g{standard processing loop}.
